+    Test for issue reported in https://github.com/sympy/sympy/issues/17949.
+
+    This test reproduces the `AttributeError: 'Zero' object has no attribute 'cols'`.
+    The original bug occurred when an intermediate multiplication created a
+    BlockMatrix containing a scalar `Zero` instead of a `ZeroMatrix`. In modern
+    SymPy, the constructor has stricter validation that prevents this.
+
+    To reproduce the exact failure condition, this test bypasses the
+    `BlockMatrix` constructor's validation by using `Expr.__new__`. This allows
+    the creation of the malformed `BlockMatrix` containing a scalar `Zero`.
+
+    Calling `_blockmul` on this object then triggers the `AttributeError`,
+    causing this test to fail as expected on a buggy version.

+    # whose `blocks` contained scalar Zeros.
+    # We manually construct this malformed block structure.

+    # The following line will raise `AttributeError: 'Zero' object has no attribute 'cols'`
+    # on a buggy version of SymPy, causing the test to fail and thus demonstrating
+    # the bug. On a fixed version, this operation would be corrected to not
+    # produce scalar Zeros, and this test would pass.
