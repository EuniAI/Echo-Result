+def test_lassolarsic_copy_x_is_overwritten():
+    """
+    Test that LassoLarsIC's fit method incorrectly overwrites constructor's copy_X.
+
+    The bug is that the `copy_X=True` default in the `fit` method signature
+    overrides the `copy_X` value provided to the constructor. This test
+    verifies that when `copy_X=False` is set in the constructor, the input
+    array `X` is NOT modified in-place by the underlying `lars_path`
+    function as it should be.
+
+    We engineer a dataset where the last column is most correlated with y.
+    A correct in-place fit would swap this last column to the first position in X.
+    The test asserts that the first column of X is NOT the original last column,
+    which will be true if the bug exists, causing the test to fail.
+    """
+    # Create a dataset where the last feature is the most correlated.
+    # This forces lars_path to swap the last column to the first position
+    # if it modifies the array in-place.
+    rng = np.random.RandomState(0)
+    X_train = rng.randn(10, 5)
+    y_train = 2 * X_train[:, -1]
+
+    # Keep a copy of the original last column to check against later
+    original_last_col = X_train[:, -1].copy()
+
+    # We expect lars_path to operate on X_train in-place because copy_X=False.
+    # fit_intercept=False is used to prevent in-place centering, simplifying
+    # the test to only check for the effect of lars_path's column swapping.
+    estimator = linear_model.LassoLarsIC(copy_X=False, fit_intercept=False)
+    estimator.fit(X_train, y_train)
+
+    # With the bug, `fit` calls `lars_path` with `copy_X=True`, so a copy
+    # is made inside `lars_path` and the original `X_train` is not modified.
+    # Therefore, the first column of X_train will not have been swapped with the last.
+    # This assertion will FAIL because the columns are not equal, thus
+    # demonstrating the bug. When the bug is fixed, the swap will occur,
+    # and the assertion will pass.
