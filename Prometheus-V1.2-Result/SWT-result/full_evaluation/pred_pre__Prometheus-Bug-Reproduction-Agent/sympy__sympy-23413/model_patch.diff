+    Tests for a bug where HNF incorrectly identifies a matrix as
+    rank-deficient, based on a user-provided example.
+
+    This test uses an interpretation of the user's `np.flip` that flips
+    along both axes, which is the default numpy behavior and leads to a
+    different input matrix that may trigger the bug. The assertion checks
+    for the correct output shape, as the bug is reported to remove a row
+    (i.e., change the shape).

+    # The user's expression starts with `np.flip(np.array(...))`.
+    # The default for np.flip on a 2D array is to reverse both axes.
