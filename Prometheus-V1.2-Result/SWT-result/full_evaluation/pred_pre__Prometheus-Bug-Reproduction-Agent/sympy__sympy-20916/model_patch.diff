+    are used. The bug report indicates that in a matrix context, 'w0' can be
+    incorrectly pretty-printed as the Greek letter omega 'ω' followed by a
+    digit '0', instead of the correct Latin letter 'w' with a subscript '₀'.
+
+    This test will fail if the bug is present and pass once it is fixed.
