# Echo-Result

> Benchmark results and performance comparisons for different versions of Echo test case generation approaches.

## Overview

This repository contains comprehensive experimental results comparing various approaches to automated test case generation, specifically focusing on reproduction test case generation techniques.

## Results Included

### 🔬 Prometheus-V1.2-Result
**Baseline Approach** - Uses regression testing exclusively to generate reproduction test cases. This represents the traditional approach without feedback refinement.

### ✨ Echo-with-Patch Result
**Enhanced Approach** - Leverages execution feedback to iteratively refine and improve generated test cases. This approach demonstrates how feedback-driven refinement can enhance test case quality and effectiveness.

## Key Differences

- **Prometheus-V1.2**: Pure regression-based test generation
- **Echo-with-Patch**: Execution feedback-guided refinement for superior test case quality
